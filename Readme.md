# Christmas Cipher Gift üéÅüîê

## Overview

This festive Flask web application aims to add an element of surprise and excitement to Christmas gifting. Instead of traditional gift tags, spice up your presents with a fun and interactive twist using the Christmas Cipher Gift!

## How It Works

1. **Encryption**: Enter a unique encryption key and a personalized message for your gift recipient [/encrypt](http://127.0.0.1:5000/encrypt).
2. **QR Code**: The application generates a QR code for the encrypted message.
3. **Gift Tag**: Print the QR code and attach it to your gift as a unique and interactive gift tag.

On Christmas day, your recipient can use the web app to decrypt the message, unveiling the heartfelt note you've hidden within the cipher.
